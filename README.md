# DotWalkR - an evolutionary simulation

DotWalkR is an evolutionary simulation that uses a forward Euler 'walk' to simulate organism lineage (dots) through a parameter space. Each dimensional axis represents an orthogonal parameter. The performance of the lineage in the parameter space is a function of the position of the animal in the space (a scalar function).


The change in position during each time step (`deltaf`) is determined by two elements:
 
 * Directional selection is imposed on the animals to force them to interact with the gradient:
 
    `k*walktowards*beta[j, ]*delta.t` 

    where `k` is the selection-heritability coefficient, `walktowards` specifies walking up or down the gradient, `beta` is the gradient at the positions of the dots, and `delta.t` is the time step.
    
 * Randomness is injected by adding a pseudo-random number multiplied by 
 
     `randscale*(1 - A)*M*(1-k)*delta.t`
     
    where `randscale` is a scaling factor, `A` is a matrix determined by Sobol Indices, and `M` is a set of pseudo-random numbers.
    
The scalar functions themselves are based on a 21x21x21 matrix of output values, representing a down-sampled gPC surrogate function. In order to estimate the gradient of the scalar function at each dot's position, DotWalkR uses a Nearest Neighbor search function to find the closest grid points within the matrix of output values, then calculates a weighted mean of the surrogate value to use in the simulation. 

Input data for DotWalkR are: 

 * __Input data__: the x, y, and z coordinates of points on the input grid in one matrix file in long format (9261x3) with each column representing a dimensional coordinate value and each row representing a grid point in the domain. 
 * __Surrogate__: the values of the surrogate function at each grid point in the domain in long format. This is downsampled from the full gPC surrogate function. 
 * __gradx, grady, gradz__: the scalar values of each gradient along each dimensional coordinate necessary for the walkrs to determine the direction and magnitude of each step they should take. These three matrices are also in long format. 
 * __SI__: a matrix of 3 x 3 values of the Sobol indices of each dimensional coordinate and their interactions in the format:  
   <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A=\begin{bmatrix}SI_x&SI_{x\&y}&SI_{x\&z}\\SI_{x\&y}&SI_y&SI_{y\&z}\\SI_{x\&z}&SI_{y\&z}&SI_z\end{bmatrix}" />

A variety of example input data are provided with the code in the data/example-data folder. These are: 

 * Bird gliding: 
    * clcd: maximum lift-to-drag ratio.
    * clvz: maximum lift coefficient at minimum sinking speed.
    * clcdclvz: a combined surrogate where each CLCD and CLVZ are weighted 50%. 
 * Crab sniffing: 
    * leakiness: leakiness of a 3-hair array. 
    * concwater: concentration of target odor captured by the 3-hair array in water conditions.
    * concair: concentration of traget odor captured by the 3-hair array in air conditions.
 * Tunicate heart pumping:
    * Q: volumne flow rate generated by the pumping heart.
    * COT: cost of transport of a unit of fluid by the pumping heart.
    * COTQ: a linear combination of COT and Q where each are weighted 50%.

Output for DotWalkR are the 3-dimensional positions and surrogate value at that position of each walking dot at the user-specified save intervals and at the beginning and end of the simulation. These will be found in the results/ folder corresponding to the simulation's date and number (assigned at run time). 


## Installing DotWalkR
After opening the RStudio project (or setting the working directory as the dotwalkr/ directory), source the install script: 

`> source('install_dotwalkr.R')`

This will install and load the required packages as well as run tests associated with the code. You will get one warning (this is ok!), all the tests should pass. 


## Required packages

These are the current required packages that must be installed before running DotWalkR: 

 * R.matlab
 * pracma
 * data.table
 * doParallel
 * foreach
 * testthat
 * viridis (for plotting only)

## How to run

If you'd like to play around with the code, feel free to:  

 1. Open the RStudio R Project file associated with the code (or set the working directory as the dotwalkr/ directory).
 2. Set the parameters. You have two options: 
    - Change the default parameters in ./data/parameter-files/parameters-template. Each parameter name should be separated by a single space from its value. Valid choices for surrogate.name are clcd, clvz, or clcdclvz. You're welcome to change the number of cores to run the program on (copl) but it will automatically run on all available cores if this number is too big.
    - Provide your own parameter file to run. In this case, be sure to set the value `parameter.filename <- "yourparameterfile"` in the console before running DotWalkR. Be sure the parameter file is placed in the ./data/parameter-files directory. 
 3. Run the main program by entering in the R console: 
    
    `> source("./src/dotwalkr.R")`

## Parameter values in parameter-template

 * `n` is the number of lineages (dots) to evolve (walk)
 * `init.x` is the initial x position of the dots
 * `init.y` is the initial y position of the dots
 * `init.z` is the initial z posiiton of the dots
 * `dN` is the number of the nearest neighbors that will be used to calculate a weighted mean of the surrogate value based on each point. (Suggested that you do not change this.)
 * `end.time` is the number of generates that the simulation will run for. 
 * `walktowards` is a value that will assign a direct to the motion relative to the gradient. Positive 1 will make the dots walk up the gradient and negative one will make the dots walk down the gradient. (All examples should be +1, if you'd like dots to walk towards a valley, change to -1.)
 * `k` is the heritability or strength of selection parameter. Lower values will make the steps taken based on the gradient of the surrogate smaller, higher values will make them larger. 
 * `t.save.interval` is the number of time steps you'd like to set between when the dot data are saved. 
 * `copl` is the number of cores to use in parallel. For running sequentially, set to 1. If this value is larger than the number of available cores, the simulation will run on the number of the available cores. 
 * `windows` is a logical parameter that indicates you are using Windows operating system (TRUE) or another system (FALSE). The default is FALSE. You must change this parameter for use with the doParallel and foreach packages. (An incorrect value manifests as an error with data.table.)
 * `resume` is a character string which will allow you to resume a stopped simulation. If you wish a new simulation, set to FALSE; if you want to resume a simulation, give the path to the saved CSV file that you wish to use (ex: resume ./results/keckrun2/dots_10000.csv).
 * `test` is a logical parameter to indicate whether or not the simulation is in test mode. Please leave as FALSE. 
 * `example` is a logical parameter to indicate whether you would like to use the example data provided with the repository. If you are using your own data, set as FALSE.
 * `surrogate.name` is the name of the surrogate value that you'd like to use for the simulation. Current valid values while `example` is TRUE are clcd, clvz, and clcdclvz. Be sure to check the example data path structure if using your own data, it needs to be in the form: ./data/`surrogate.name`/`surrogate.name`_`input names`.mat 
 * `use.SI` is a logical parameter that indicates whether or not you would like to use the SI values in a mat file associated with your surrogate. If FALSE, it creates its own matrix which will weight the random walk equally in all directions. 

## More About k
 
The selection-heritability coefficient `k` modifies the relative size of the steps between the selection component of the model to the random steps. The behavior of step size also depends on the time step size `delta.t`. Here is a table that describes the relative change in step size based on changing `k` with a single example surrogate. 

| `k` | `delta.t` | `k*delta.t` | `(1/k)*delta.t` | Selection to random ratio |
|:---:|:---------:|:-----------:|:---------------:|:-------------------------:|
| 10  |   0.01995 |   0.1995    |      0.001995   |          100              |
|  1  |   0.1995  |   0.1995    |      0.1995     |           1               |
| 0.1 |   1.995   |   0.01995   |      1.995      |          0.01             |
| 0.01|  19.95    |   0.1995    |   1995          |         0.0001            |
 
## Optional Scaling Study

There is a scaling study provided with the DotWalkR main code's tests/ directory. Running this on a high-performance computing resource (or your local machine) can help you decide how to most efficiently run large-scale simulations. 

Right now, scaling_study.R (in tests/) is set up to run on 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 cores (`copls` on line 7) using 10, 100, 1000, 10000, and 100000 dots (`ns` on line 8). You may change these to suit your own needs, feel free to explore your HPC resource. It outputs a CSV file which can be loaded and graphed using the commented code with the ggplot2 package.
